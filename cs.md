## 5. Question time! (~15 mins) [2p]

###  What is the difference between id and class in CSS? [2p]
#### Your answer: 

The main difference is that id's are unique, while classes are not. There should be only one element with a specific id on a page, and one element can have only one id. On the contrary class is a bigger category than id - more elements can belong to the same class (you can tag more elements with the same class), and one element can have several class tags.
